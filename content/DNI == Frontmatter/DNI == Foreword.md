Well. Look at that. "Red September" in your hands. Crazy, huh?

It certainly feels crazy to me, that's for sure. I'm still pretty gobsmacked at how long my interest in this setting and its characters has lasted.

If you're a long-time fan of the first series, "Glitter City Knights", you'll likely feel right at home here. If you started with "the Spring Castle Legacy", then this one might feel like a bit of a departure.

It is, but it's back to where I came from, because I felt it was the best narrative solution for the story that wanted to be told. I'll be surprised if the next novel isn't in the same multi-character perspective as the first two of the series.

Either way, thanks for being here. Without readers, stories are just trees falling in forests, unheard and unmissed.

As always, thanks to <<sweetheart>> and <<muses>>.
