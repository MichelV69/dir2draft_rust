"According to witnesses, a person or persons unknown ran Officer Kolpack's vehicle off the road using a text-book Tactical Vehicle Intervention manoeuvre. The hit-and-run was done at high speed, and his vehicle went down an embankment, rolling several times. Officer Kolpack died before medical attention arrived," Sheriff Russell stated in a clinical voice.

"The stolen vehicle was found abandoned about four miles away, at the bottom of a similar embankment and in similar condition. The driver was not with the vehicle. The area is being searched by the State and City right now; I'd normally object to the intrusion into our jurisdiction, but right now, I think we can all agree we have other things on our mind."

"How is Verra?" Tammy asked.

Russel glanced at her. "The funeral will have to be closed casket. How do you _think_ she's doing right now?"

Everyone winced.

"Now, listen up," Russell growled. "This was murder. Someone just killed one of ours. We don't yet know why, so until further notice, everyone doubles up on patrols. Two people on foot, two people in a car. Make sure your doors are locked if you're at home, and keep your sidearm with you at all times. Everyone understand?"

The assembled group nodded slowly.

"Last comment. If you are in a position to apprehend, presume the assailant is armed and dangerous. And don't forget the two kids that don't have a Daddy as of just after ten-thirty tonight."
