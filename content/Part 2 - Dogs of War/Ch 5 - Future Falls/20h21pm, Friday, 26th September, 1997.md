"Lady Jessica, it's Deputy Emerret."

"Oink, oink!"

"Well, if you're going to be like that about it," he intoned, mostly mimicking '*Fritz*'.

Jess burst into giggles on her end of the call. "What's up? How's my favorite Fuzz?"

"I thought you didn't like Cops?"

"I hate 'em, Em. I *said* you were my favorite, I *didn't* say it was a long list," she quipped.

Emerret laughed. "I s'pose that's fair. Look, Fugly is comin' to visit the neighbourhood in a big way. Lady Sharlene was wonderin' if you could do your Voodoo and have a sniff around for new patches of [[Cult of Rar’zhaz’hauk|Cult]] Crab Grass sproutin' up in the local area."

"Um, since it's you that's asking, and you're kind of cute when you blush, I'd be happy to."

Emerret shook his head, happy that video phones were still science fiction. "That's mighty kind of ya. Is there anything you need from me?"

"Um, the Piranha need to be fed?" Jess snickered.

"Other than that, o'course," he sighed.

"Oh, yes, of course, right, right," she kept snickering. "Chain yanking aside, nah, I should be fine. If you want to hang out just for the fun of watching the sparks and arcs, it'll cost you an extra large long double with a dash of Tobascco."

"You … *weirdo*! You put *Tobascco sauce* in your *coffee* ?! What the actual Hell, woman?!"

"I *told* you that mine was a special kind of evil."

"You've got me convinced now, tha's fer sure," he laughed. "Where do you usually pick up your coffee?"

"'*[[Cafe - Tastes of Oran|Tastes of Oran]]*'", she replied. "If you ask for a *'grave-waker coffee'*, Leanii will know what you mean."

"Okay. Give me forty-five minutes or so, and I'll drop by the shop. I've got some questions for you about a future problem."

"Okay. Now I'm curious. You'd better add some chocolate *éclairs* to the order."

"Okay. Now I feel like I'm being taken advantage of," Emerret chuckled.

"Heck yes. Oink!" She hung up.
