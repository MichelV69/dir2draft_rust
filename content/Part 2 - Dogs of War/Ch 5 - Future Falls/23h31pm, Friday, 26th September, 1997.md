The silence was hideous.

Emerret was numbly aware of the noises as the wrecker truck unloaded the crumpled and bloody mess that was Charlie's squad car into the fenced parking area behind the station. The grinding of bent metal against shredded rubber, the wail of hydraulics, the muddy rumble of the wrecker truck's diesel engine and the sound of his own heart beat in his ears were all there at the edge of his awareness.

But the silence of the stunned group of officers and support staff -- many of whom had known each other for five, ten, fifteen, twenty or more years -- was hideous. Two reporters, one from the local paper, and one from downtown Denver, took photos and made notes as the Sheriff spoke with them.

Everyone else just stood there, hands at their sides, watching the macabre movement of machinery in a wordless void. Tammy slowly drifted to stand beside him, wiping at her eyes.

Emerret nearly jumped when she put a hand on his elbow and then silently pointed with the other towards the back quarter panel of the car, now sitting on the pavement. The painted serial of "*SCSO057*" was mostly legible.

"Wait," Emerret said aloud, shattering the silence with a low voice. "That's my car."

Tammy nodded at him and then looked away. After a moment of biting her lip and visibly forcing herself to keep her calm she returned her gaze generally towards his.

"His wouldn't start when he went on shift; alternator or something. So, he knew you were off on Policy Time, so he took yours for highway patrol," Tammy said quietly.

Laura Ayala Gonzalez, a Puerto Rican and the singular active-duty woman on the Force, was his *"older sister"* here. She'd started about a year before he did, and she was nearly two years older than he was. "Charlie was good people," she whispered in shock. "What the hell happened out there?"

Sheriff Jimmy Russell came over to the group. "Let's go inside, and I'll tell you what we know. It ain't good. But, you all need to remember, this is part of the risk of being an officer of the Law. We put ourselves out there so that those we protect can be safe."
