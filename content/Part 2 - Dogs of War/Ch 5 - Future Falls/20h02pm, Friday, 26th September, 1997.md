"No fucking way. Not happening. Not while I'm still walking this Gawdforsaken rock," Sharlene growled from her end of the phone call.

"Well, I ain't too keen on dyin' neither, Sharley," Emerett chuckled. "Not any time soon, at least. An' certainly not bein' gunned down. I jus' wanted to get you caught up. The important part of it all is that it looks like someone we don't know is spoilin' for a big fight with all of us over at Eden. The Wolves are makin' ready to be there for us when it happens."

"I appreciate it, Em," Sharlene said softly. "I don't want you going out any way that you don't choose. That's the whole thing about a Willing End; Afterliving or not, you pick. You're my friend; I'll be more Damned if I let anyone take that choice away from you. But, you're right, we need to start thinking about what the Hell might be going on. Hmmm. Call Lady Jessica."

"Lady Jessica? How come?"

"Lady Vangie told me once that the Pillars have a way of getting advance notice if the Cult are hanging around. If anyone is likely to want a big bloody fight with us out in the open, it's them. They're off their rockers, and aren't at all worried about the opinion of the Halls of the Sun."

"I was talking to her last night, and she's movin' her Lab out to the Farm early next week. I'll give her a ring as soon as we're done talkin', an' hopefully she ain't got stuff already torn apart for the move."

"She's moving the Lab out to the [[de Villerary Farm|Farm]] ?" Sharlene questioned, sounding surprised. Emerret could all but hear her blinking in disbelief.

"Un-huh. Lady Constance is settin' her up in the old Carriage House. She gets the ground floor for the Lab, and the loft for her apartment. 'Parrently it was Lady Constance's idea."

"I'm not surprised. The only two people in the whole of the Court and Community that don't know that Jess desperately wants in Ryan's pants, and that he'd be happy to have her there, are Jess and Ryan," Sharley laughed.

"Lady Constance is doing her most to live by the _'if you love someone, set them free'_ idea when it comes to Lord Ryan," she concluded, sounding slightly impressed.

Emerret glanced at the cellphone in his hand, wondering if Sharley had just heard what she'd said. He paused for a moment, and decided not to comment on it. Before he said anything else, Sharlene made a thoughtful noise and then resumed speaking.

"Tomorrow morning, head out to the [[County Airport]] and have a walk around," she said slowly.

"Oh?"

"Yeah. Ask a few questions if anyone's seen or heard anything weird around there lately. Other than Andy Lee. I don't know of a lot of helicopter traffic happening around here. Andy keeps his bird in Hangar Four when he's not flying it; he's got a year lease on that. So, if anyone mentions a chopper other than his, that'll give us a lead about what the Hell might be coming at We All."

"Good thinking, Boss. I'll do that. This is going to get awkward. If I'm sniffin' around in Unseen business, it's not like I can be havin' anyone at the [[Spring Castle Sheriff's Office|Station]] involved in what I'm doin'."

"If you have to, put in for some vacation time next week to make sure you're free and clear to work. One thing I've learned is that when the _Vülfen_ Crones smell something, it's already heading towards you and picking up steam. They're just giving you enough notice to jump off the tracks. If you need me, call me, got it?"

"Will do. Hmm. Um …"

"What?"

"Do you mind payin' for a round-trip plane ticket from [[Glitter City - FLA|Glitter City]]?" Emerret asked carefully.

There was a slight pause. "No. Make it happen. She can cover you while the sun is up. That's smart thinking. Alright; you go call Lady Jessica. I'm going to call the Duchess; the Four need to talk about this ASAP. Take care of yourself, Em."

"You, too, Sharley. It's not just me at risk here."

"I know. As Anoki would joke, this might be '_so damn trope it hurts_', but this thing coming down the rails sounds bigger than all of us."
