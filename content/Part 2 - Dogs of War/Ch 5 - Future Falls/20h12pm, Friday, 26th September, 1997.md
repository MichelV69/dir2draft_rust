Spring Castle Reaper's Deputy Emerret Andrew Moore listened to the ring of the Nokia eighty-one-ten he held. "Come on, woman, answer the phone," he sighed. He was sitting on his couch, with some of his parent's country music playing, and the sound of Rosie having a shower keeping the silence at a safe distance.

"Yeah, what's wrong?" The voice on the other end of the call was sharp with concern.

"Jay, it's Em."

"Yeah, I know; I can read Caller ID. What's wrong?"

"What do you mean?" Emerret questioned.

"I can't remember any time in all the time I've known you that you've called me twice in ten days, let alone twice in five. So, something's up. You're *Sharley's* Retainer; if you're calling because something is up, it means something *mean* is going down."

"Uh, yeah. I can't discuss it on the phone, o'course. So, how's about I meet you in the Red Card section of the [[Rialto (Eden) Club Complex|Rialto]] tomorrow night to talk about it."

"You're buying the drinks."

"O'course."

"Alright. I'll let Gabe know what is up and I'll keep an eye on my email for the deets."

"Thanks, Jay."

"Anytime, Em. See you tomorrow night. Oh! Am I staying at your place?"

"Um."

"That's not the level of enthusiasm I was expecting," Jeanie remarked dryly.

"Naw, naw, that ain't it, Jay … It's just … well, I got a girl. She's live in."

"Weren't you single like, what, two days ago?" Jeanie questioned. "Like, totally *'not doing relationships, my Cop-ness is my Life'?*"

"Um. Yeah."

"I *cannot* wait to meet this chick. She's in The Know, yeah? She'd have to be."

"Um, yeah, you could say that."

"Em?"

"Um. She's *Vülfen*."

There was a moment of dead silence on Jeanie's end of the call, followed but a burst of uproarious laughter. "Either you were seriously holding back on me, or I cannot wait to meet the first *Vülf*-chick in history recreationally taking 'Ludes as an aphrodisiac."

"JAY!" Emerret exclaimed, sounding mortified and scandalized at once.

"Yeah, I *definitely* want to meet her. Bring her with you tomorrow night. I am *totally* wearing my micro-mini and club-crop-top and sitting in your lap as soon as I see you. Probably won't bother with a bra, and go really hard on the vamp-tramp make-up, too."

"JAY!"

"This is gonna be a howl. See you tomorrow night, Em!" Jeanie said with cheerful malice, and hung up.
