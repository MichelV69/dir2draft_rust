"Jack shit," Jess announced after the second review of the various screens, lights and glowing crystals before her. The air hummed with voltage and the sounds of spark-gap discharges, and of vacuum tubes riding the ragged edge of disaster. Laced into that were innumerable vibrations of things that needed to be visited with a wrench, and the whirring of cooling fans and pumps.

A small waterfall poured at the back of the place, nearly two feet wide and eight feet tall. Steam curled off the surface of the water, and the basin glowed with a dozen or more crystals.

CRT screens glowed in a handful of shades of green or amber, from a variety of locations, basking the poorly lit place in a horror-house glow. Jess, for her part, moved around as though it were a brightly lit grocery store.

The sharp smells of ozone, peroxide, alcohol and formaldehyde tugged at his senses constantly in a distracting way. Emerret wondered if the County Morgue smelled like this, too.

"Well, damn," Emerret said, sounding puzzled. "With the way Sharley was talkin', I think she full-on expected a whole bushel of them somewhere near."

"Nope. Nothing at all that looks like the signature of a [[Cult of Rar’zhaz’hauk|Cult]] *Malhadie*," Jess stated. "Once you've seen what they look like on a Thaumaetheric Carto-Pulse, they're pretty obvious."

She sipped at her coffee, a critical frown forming on her features as she stared at the equipment in front of her. "Huh. That's funny," she said slowly. She picked up an *éclair* from a plate which was precariously perched atop something dangerous looking. The device in question periodically made dubious electrical noises. With her other hand, she flicked a gauge a couple of times.

"What's up?"

"Oh, well, like I said … the total result is '*no not [[Cult of Rar’zhaz’hauk|Cult]]*'. But … this one here says '*but something else weird*'. By *'weird'*, I mean, I've never seen that result before."

"Any guesses?"

She pursed her lips, twisted a knob and moved a slider up and then down slightly. "I think it's essentially a refracted echo of the 'pulse." She licked her fingers clean hastily, scribbled some complicated math on a sheet of paper, and then fiddled with a slide-rule that was partly numbers and partly what looked like Egyptian hieroglyphs to Emerret. She raised an eyebrow, and then did the whole process again, notably more slowly.

"Yeah. It's got to be a refracted echo. It's telling me the gang at [[One Sunset Court|One Sunset]] are thirty-three miles away."

"So nothing to worry about?"

Jessica shook her head. "Nope. Oh, and thanks for the delivery order. I really appreciate it, all teasing and shanking aside."

"Hey, Jess, no problem. I appreciate you being willing to take up the cause on short notice like this," Emerret answered.

Jess grinned at him. "I'm just happy that I can help the Community. I can't explain how fuckin' awesome it is to know that I'm helping a Real Cop take care of the safety of the mixed Community of Afterliving, *Dämonvülfen*, Magi, and all their staff. Like, this is beyond wildest dreams kind of stuff. I'm not just doing stuff because I need to practice. I'm doing stuff because it *matters*."

Emerret gave her a lopsided smile. "Now you know how I feel. Every day, I wake up in the morning, and I wonder to myself how the Hell I got so lucky. I didn't study until I had headaches in high-school and then go to the Academy for eighteen months to spend all my time writing traffic tickets, asking pretty girls to stay off the tables, and asking construction workers to turn it down a little."

Jessica laughed and shook her head. "No, I imagine not. So what's going on, anyway? You've never made a request like this before."

"Well, the *Vülf* Crones have had a premonition that the gang at One Sunset are gonna get pulled into some kind of late-night street fight somewhere and take a beating. As a result of that, I wind up going somewhere that has a helicopter landed, and gettin' shot."

"Whoa. Yeah, I'm really not in favour of that," Jess said sharply.

"Funny enough, neither am I. Rosie ain't too keen on it, neither."

"You two are such a cute couple," Jess giggled. "You're both terrified you're going to hose the whole thing, but you're both so head-over-heels you can't help but free-dive anyway."

"Thanks, I think," Emerret replied and shook his head.

"It's a compliment. I'm always so used to seeing folks playing their cards against their chest because of how much hurt they've had already," she said.

She frowned, and continued in a wistful tone. "It's hard to trust after you get the earth scorched by someone you committed to. It's kind of nice to see a couple that aren't holding anything back out of fear."

"Well, I mean, we met on a battlefield with her in full *Homolupus* form. As she put it, there's no amount of paint or varnish is going to gloss over that. You don't get much more raw. So, we really don't have anything left to hide, if that makes sense?"

Jess nodded. "That's an interesting way to look at things, Em. I'm glad we get to talk sometimes. You're good at making me think. Now get out of here so I can take care of some Evil Hot Girl Stuff."

"What if I want to hang out and watch? All this gear here is mighty fascinatin'."

"I won't use the blender before I feed the Piranha," she answered with a toothy grin.

"I'm out. See you later at [[Rialto (Eden) Club Complex|Eden]]."
