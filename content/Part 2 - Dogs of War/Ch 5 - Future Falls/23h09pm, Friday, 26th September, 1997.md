"Good evening, Lady Tiffany. I hope you don't mind me takin' up a few minutes of your Night," Emerret said.

They were at [[Rialto (Eden) Club Complex|Eden]], and he'd found The Keeper relaxing by the bar. Given that neither the remainder of The Four nor Anoki were there with her, he decided it was a good time to talk shop.

As usual, she was looking stunningly pretty in some high-end fashion cocktail dress. It was something Emerret was always surprised that he still noticed; each and every one of the women he dealt with in the Night was an absolute looker in their own right, and he still hadn't gotten numb to that. In its own way, he considered it a good sign that beauty still registered with him.

"Oh, hello, Deputy Emerret. How is the Night treating you?" Tiffany smiled happily at him.

"Oh, not bad, ma'am. I'm workin' on this mess we got from the Crones, and it's got me chasin' circles, it feels like. Somethin' ain't addin' up right, but I can't quite figure out what."

"You're good at what you do, Deputy. The Lady Reaper always speaks well of you, both personally and professionally. I have confidence you'll get the job done."

"Well, thank-you, ma'am. That's mighty kind of you. If you don't mind the question, you have ties to the Smaldota Family in Denver-proper, yeah?"

Tiffany nodded. "Yup! I expect the middle boy of the family will be joining us here in [[Rialto (Eden) Club Complex|Eden]] as a Retainer sometime in the next six months."

"Huh. Well, that'll make for some interestin' company at the bar for the likes of me, that's for sure," Emerret chuckled. "Can I get you to ask 'em, on the QT of course, if they are doin' a big weapons deal this weekend? Right here in [[Spring Castle - CO|Spring Castle]]?"

Lady Tiffany raised an eyebrow. "That's an interesting question. How big?"

"According to the police intel, it's shotguns, shells and grenades by the case."

"Huh. Well. That sounds *delightfully* sketchy, doesn't it?" She waved at one of the bartenders and gestured to the phone. It was unhooked from its spot on the wall and brought over to her spot at the bar, with the brightly marked phone cable swaying slightly in the gap between. She flipped open a proverbial little black book, and dialed a number.

"Tony! It's Tiffany. Oh, good to hear your voice too, darling … Yes, oh, tomorrow Night is full … how about Monday? … Mmmm-hmmm, I'd love to … So, do you mind a question, my friend? A little bird tells me you're running weapons through my backyard.

"Sweetie, why didn't you let me know, so none of my people interfered? … Oh, really? … So it's *not* Family business?" Tiffany shot a puzzled look at Emerret.

"You say you've no clue who it is running the gun show? … Hmm? Oh, no, it's none of our people, which is why I'm calling, silly boy … Oh, of course, Tony, I'll ensure a couple of my best people look into it and let you know … Oh, I agree, darling; I don't want anyone challenging your supremacy over the area with this sort of thing, either …

"Oh, my … well, darling, I'll be sure to bring something to change into for later … Yes, yes, see you Monday, halfway to midnight as usual … Cheers, darling!"

Tiffany hung up and frowned at the phone. "Someone is either incredibly stupid, or incredibly bold," she stated.

"Yeah, runnin' guns through Mob territory without askin' permission is the sorta thing that'll get your breakfast ruined without warning some mornin'," Emerret answered.

"Well, well," she said slowly. "So someone new is playing games. I refuse to accept this as a coincidence, that this is happening here and now."

Anything else she was going to say was interrupted by the phone ringing as it was being taken back to it's spot on the wall by one of the bartenders.

The bartender chuckled in amusement at the situation and answered, identifying himself as staff at the [[Rialto (Eden) Club Complex|Rialto Club]] downstairs. They passed the phone to Emerret; "It's for you."

"Emerret here."

"Emerret? It's Tammy from work. Get yourself to the [[Spring Castle Sheriff's Office|Station]] as quick as you can; full call-in on the Sheriff's orders. Charlie's dead."
