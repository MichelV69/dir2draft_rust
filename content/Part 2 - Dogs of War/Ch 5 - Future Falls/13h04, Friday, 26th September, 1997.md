"So I'm dead, then," Emerret said in a numb and quiet voice. Sitting beside him, Rosie squeezed his hand. "Sometime. Soon. Alone."

EasyStreet bit her lip. "I'm sorry."

"Not your fault, Miz. You and the others are just the messenger, not the writers."

Chainlink sat down on a log opposite Emerret and Rosie, across the small campfire near the Scrying Pool. The smell of sage and pine resin hung in the air, and thin curls of smoke drifted upwards from the fire. She had a sip from the coffee mug in her hand and gave a critical look at sombre expressions of the others gathered around the fire.

"We aren't gonna let this happen without a fight," Sherman said firmly.

"I keep forgetting how young all of you are," Chainlink said, sounding slightly amused. "It's not going to happen at all."

"What?" Rosie asked, blinking.

"Chainlink, all of us Crones saw the _same_ thing," EasyStreet glared.

"Yeah, we all did. But the whole reason we Crones exist, Girl, is to fix futures we don't like the look of," Chainlink countered. "He's no more Doomed than he wants to be. This isn't the Spring Communion; this isn't the _'has to happen'_ list. This is the Stones and the Moon hitting the warning button so we can take action to take care of someone important to the Pack."

"I'm sorry, I can be a bit slow some days when sufferin' from unexpected existential terror …" Emerret began carefully. "We can _change_ what you saw?"

Chainlink gave him a friendly smile and a nod. "Yep. That's why we get told stuff like this. The Crones are the ones allowed to put our paws on the scales of the Universe to tip things the way we please. Even if we weren't too keen on you, we're all pretty keen on our Healer-girl Rosie there, so none of us want to see her wearing black with puffy eyes for the next six months or so."

"So what do we do?" Rosie asked, sounding hopeful.

"And how do we help?" Sherman questioned, clearly ready to take immediate action.

"So, reminder, what we saw is what _will_ happen if we do _nothing_. In that version of the future, our friends at Eden get their asses kicked in a massive street-fight somewhere. Shit has gone seriously sideways if you ever see two women like Belinda and Sharley standing back to back with drawn steel. Whatever that fight means, it results in Emerret going somewhere alone, to a place with a helicopter on a landing pad. Because he's alone, he gets dirt napped."

"Well," Sherman said thoughtfully. "The only place around here for a helicopter would be the County airport. No, no, hang on! Susie-girl's boss is building a _brand-new_ helicopter landing pad out at the [[JP Estate|Estate]] that some of us are working construction and security at."

"That would make some sense," Can-Can stated thoughtfully as he arrived. Vangie was walking beside him, looking pensive. On his other side was Dead-Nickel, wearing a grim expression.

"The place is a [[JP Estate|mercenary base disguised as an Old Money Euro-zone mansion]]. If the Afterliving take a shit-kicking at the hands of someone, that would be the place they'd want to pull back to. A few of the Girls have told stories about the kind of damage those mercs working for JP can do. And we all remember the bruises we took from Jukebox Rugby with them."

Sherman looked over at Emerret. "So, no solo-hero shit Pally. Got it? I'll get damn unhappy at you if you make my little sister cry."

"Oh," Can-Can chuckled. "_You're_ the one the Techies have been talking about. Paladin; yeah. I can see that. It suits you."

"It sure does," Sherman said with a nod. "We don't just give Pack Names away, Pally. Even to _Vülfen_. You _earn_ them, understand? You don't pick your Name; your Pack does. It's how we say we see you, we know you, we appreciate you, and you're _us_."

Can-Can nodded. "Yep. And solo is no-go for anyone part of a Pack. If for any reason the other Cops at the Station won't show, or whatever … you call _us_ for back-up. We'll be there for you."

Emerret looked around the small group at the fire, feeling a bit overwhelmed. "I … I mean … well, I'll be damned, I don't rightly know what to say, other than '_thank-you_'."

"That'll do," Can-Can chuckled, and Evie jabbed him in the ribs with her elbow. "Chainlink, you're part of the Presidium. So, once the sun goes down, I want you to be calling the Duchess right away to warn them. We don't know when all this happens, but if they have to organize for a fight, they call us so we can support them. No going it alone."

"Will do, Can-Can," Chainlink replied with a nod. She paused for a moment and looked thoughtful. "There's something bothering me about this whole thing," she said.

"What's that?" Vangie questioned.

"We didn't get warned about the Afterliving, _per se_. That's not what the Moon and the Stones are warning us about. The only reason we know about that is because it's what sets the stage for what the Universe _is_ warning about; Pally getting shot by someone in front of a helicopter."

"Wait a minute!" EasyStreet protested. "That can't be right! Why would the Stones and the Moon be okay with our friends getting hurt?"

"Girl," Chainlink began slowly, "Sometimes the Moon and the Stones prioritize things by virtue of the greatest good. Sometimes, that means that stuff we don't like has to happen, to make sure that something that helps the most people out does happen. For whatever reason, that means the gang on Sunset are going to have an unfortunate night sometime in the next few weeks."

Can-Can frowned. "Well, one way to head the whole problem off is making sure they _win_ that fight, then. If they win, then the rest of the dominoes don't fall in the direction of a helicopter, right?"

"'_Probably_' is the closest we can get there, Can-Can. But, I mean, I really doubt anyone here is going to want to sit that scrap out, regardless," Chainlink chuckled.

Dead-Nickel shook her head and sighed. "I've said it before, and I'll say it again, I'm sure … but I am so damn glad you're here with us, Chainlink."

Chainlink gave a kindly smile. "I wouldn't have missed being here for a T-Bone the size of Texas," she chuckled.
