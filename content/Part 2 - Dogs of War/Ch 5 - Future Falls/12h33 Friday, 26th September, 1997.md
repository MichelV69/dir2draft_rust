"I'm kinda nervous, y'know?" Emerret said as they got out of his car.

"It's fine, Em. The fact the Crones even invited you to sit and watch while they did this says you've earned some respect around here," Rosie said, sounding encouraging. She took his hand and they started making their way towards where the Community Hall was planned for construction. The sounds of the portable pneumatic sawmill were easy to make out, as were the sounds of hand-saws and axes.

Rosie had gotten a phone call at Emerret's place from the Crones saying that everything was ready for them to try Scrying deeper into EasyStreet's premonition. They'd immediately gotten changed, and then driven out to the [[Spring Castle Pack Camp (new)|Camp]].

The noon-day sun was warm any time it peeked out from behind the scattered clouds. The mercury was expected to push into the mid-eighties by early afternoon. The breeze was steady, light and pleasant from the south, and it was full of scents of the forest as well as campfires, good food and drying laundry.

Emerret always marvelled slightly at this otherwise [[Spring Castle Pack Camp (new)|unremarkable camp]] of what most would just dismiss of "hillbillies" living in camp-trailers, driving battered pick-up trucks and cooking over wood fires as much as they could. Yet, so much of it was an illusion of preconceptions. Each and every one of these people were smart, educated, and passionate about their belief in doing good in the world.

Sharlene had made sure he understood that they chose this lifestyle, to allow them to focus the community's income on projects such as school lunches, forest conservation and restoration, plus fish-and-game projects. Instead of everyone having a brand new five-hundred dollar projection TV, they all had fixed up smaller screens, and the extra money had been split between being able to have an outdoor group movie space, and making sure the local homeless shelter had enough clean clothes and soup to pass out. Instead of everyone having the latest edition truck out of the Motor City, everyone helped everyone scrounge, fix and refurbish vehicles that were being driven by the grandsons of the men who bought them. The saved money paid for summer camps to nature spaces for needy kids.

"Heya, Pally!" Sparks waved as he and Rosie crossed the community common space. Wood was being split for the next bonfire, and the slightly built techie nick-named Sparks was sitting by the ash and coals of the previous night.

Rosie and Emerret glanced at each other. "Who'd you just greet?" Rosie questioned.

"Pally. Your fella. Torchbrake says he needs a Pack Name if he's gonna be hangin' around this much and you're shacked with him. So me and Torchbrake decided it was Pally."

"Pally?" Emerret questioned, changing the course of the couple towards Sparks. "Now, what does that mean? I don't think I've heard that one before."

"It's slang from a game we both play for a '_Paladin_'; the literal Lancelot or Gawain, the Knight In Shining Armour, the warrior who follows the call of a higher purpose and inspires everyone around them," Sparks explained.

"Well, that's interestin' an' all, but why on Earth would you call me that? Is that pokin' a bit of family-style fun?" Emerret questioned.

Rosie burst out laughing as Sparks looked skyward and rolled his eyes in an evident plea to the Universe for a delivery of fresh patience.

"Rosie, can you talk some sense into your Squeeze?" Sparks chuckled. "We're calling you that, because that's who you are! You're probably the only Cop in the Country that's ever talked to one of my Kin without either a pointing an accusation, a Warrant or a weapon. You've helped work on stuff around here, '_just to be a good neighbour_', and I'm not sure you live within twenty minutes of us. The Boys working at the [[Rialto (Eden) Club Complex|Rialto]] all know they can call you no matter what time of Night, and you're gonna be good to deal with. You've been making my friend Rosie smile for the past few months, and Jess says you're the only non-asshole cop she's ever met. I mean, I dunno what else to tell you. You're '_Pally_' _because_ you're '_Pally_'. That's how Pack Names _work_, man. It's about as obvious as why they call 'em '_light switches_', you know?"

Emerret blinked in wordless surprise at Sparks.

"I told you so," Rosie commented.

"You told me so?"

"Uh-huh. Some kind of '_knight in shining armour that's just currently slumming in GWG's_', handsome. Everyone sees that about you," she explained.

"Well, I suppose the only thing to say is thank-you, and if that's what y'all want to call me, it ain't right to argue with a compliment," he concluded with a shrug.

"You two coming, or not?" EasyStreet shouted from a small gathering beyond where the sawmill was set up. "We're waiting for you!"
