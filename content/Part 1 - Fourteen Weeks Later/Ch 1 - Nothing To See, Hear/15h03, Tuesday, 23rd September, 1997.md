Spring Castle Sheriff's Deputy Emerret Andrew Moore listened to the ring of the Nokia eighty-one-ten he held. "Come on, woman, answer the phone," he sighed. He was sitting in his cruiser, watching the flow of traffic on the highway leading to [[Truck Stop - Hauler House|Hauler House]], and then the community of [[Spring Castle - CO|Spring Castle]].

He had the windows down, allowing the chill afternoon breeze to curl through the car. The late day sun was completely hidden from view by a mixture of fog and heavy mist that swirled about with each passing vehicle.

"Yeah, what?" The voice on the other end of the call was sharp with impatience.

"Jay, it's Em."

"Yeah, I know; I can read Caller ID. What's up?"

"Good to talk to you, friend," Emerret rolled his eyes.

"Yeah, yeah. You're not calling for social reasons, Em, so get to business."

He shook his head, and gave up yet again. "Sharley wanted me to pass the message to be expecting one of our Court down to visit about two hours before sunrise tonight."

"Andy Lee doing another run?" Jeanie questioned.

"'Parently so. With the foundations bein' poured for JP's new shack, Andy's been all over the place for the past couple months," Emerret answered.

"Yeah, I think this is the third weekend in five he'll be down here in [[Glitter City - FLA|Glitter City]]. Alright. I'll let Gabe know, and call Claude once we're done talking so that the Keeper knows as well."

"Great, Jay, I 'ppreciate that."

"Doing the job, Em. How are you holding up on your side of things?" Jeanie asked.

Emerret glanced at the cellular phone in surprise. Jeanie rarely bothered with small talk, for any reason, either in person or on the phone.

"Well, it's still all weirder than Hell, but, I'm gettin' used to it," he replied. "Walked off a tyre-iron to the ribs the other night, like it weren't nothin' interesting."

"How'd the other guy take that?" Jeanie laughed.

"Oh, he done pissed himself and went white as a sheet when I asked him to kindly cut that out before I added resistin' arrest to the charges," Emerret chuckled.

Jeanie howled on her end of the call. "Alright, damn, that's a good one. I like your sense of humour, Em. I could dry my laundry with it most of the time, but it's funny as shit."

"Glad you 'ppreciate it, Jay. Are you and the Boss headin' up this way any time soon?"

"Pretty sure no. I mean, it's hard to be one-hundred-percent about anything with Gabe, but he hasn't mentioned anything either from the Duchess or the Glove. Anything going on?" Jeanie inquired.

"Oh, naw, nothin' really. A few of the fellas from the bar front of the Rialto were askin' about you."

"You're kidding, right?"

"Naw. Mike Mulcare, the pipe fitter, and Willie Juda, the fella setting up the [pool hall](pool%20hall.md) over towards [[Truck Stop - Hauler House|Hauler House]], if I'm recallin' rightly."

There was a groan followed by a sigh of annoyance. "William's not so bad, but Mike was such a jerk. Do me a favour and don't let either of them know what's up with me, okay?"

"Oh, naw, I wouldn't do that without you telling me that was what you wanted first. A lady's privacy is everything in this day and age."

"Well, yeah, even more so for women like me and Susan." There was a pause, and he could hear her transfer her phone to the other ear. "Are you sure you weren't one of the fellas from the bar front of the [[Rialto (Eden) Club Complex|Rialto]]?" Jeanie asked in a teasing voice.

"Well, I didn't want you to feel like I was bein' a creep," he answered carefully.

"We talked about it over breakfast, Em. It was mutual, it was fun, no regrets, and you've always got a spot on my dance card when I'm in the Mile High City. Both of us are in weird situations because of Gabe and Sharley; it's good to have a drinking, dancing, bitching and screwing buddy in the business."

"Alright. I just don't want you thinking it's just the last part of the list that has all of my interest."

"Nah, you're fine, Em. That's one of the things I like about you; you're a genuinely good enough person that I know you'd be more upset about you treating me that way than I would be for you doing it," she chuckled. "How are you and Her Nibbs getting along?"

"Oh, I'm as confused and mixed-up as ever, mostly 'cause she can't figure out what she wants," Emerret sighed.

"Ugh. That's trash, Em. I mean, I know she and Andy are officially an open relationship, and that she's got a soft spot for you but … Jeeze. Piss or get off the pot, bitch," Jeanie sighed, her voice full of sympathy.

"Yeah, well, I ain't so easy to spend time with, neither. A Cop is never really off duty, you know?"

Jeanie snorted. "No, Em, you are never really off duty. Most of the Blue Wall I know go home and forget about it until they get up in the morning. It's just a job."

"Well, it ain't just a job for me, Jay. I'm trying to do right by people."

"I know, Em. It's adorable, like I've said, but I like I told you before, I think you're just making your own nails. I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I just don't think the world works that way all that much."

Emerret shook his head and glanced away from the phone for a moment. "Well, either way, between the sunrise, my shift work, Andy's flight schedule, her duties around here … I might see her once a week at [[Rialto (Eden) Club Complex]], and we get to hang out elsewhere maybe once every second or third week."

"That's not a relationship, Em. That's service calls. If she's not going to make time for you, then get your heart out of it. It's not just up to you to put all the work in." There was another pause and she sighed. "Ah, fuck. I just saw the time. I should likely get off the horn here and get the last of this stuff on my list done before Gabe gets up."

"Alrighty then, Jay. Good chattin' with you. I'll tell Sharley that the message was passed and handled. Don't be a stranger, friend," Emerret offered.

"Thanks, Em. I won't be. It's good to have someone else wearing similar shoes to talk to. Same thing with you; give me a call in a couple of days, just to check in. Stay safe out there, alright?" Jeanie said.

"I do try, Jay. The good news is that it's outside of Denver, instead of New York or L.A. That makes things a whole lot less stressful right away."

The pair finished fairwells and hung up. He slid the phone closed and frowned. "Gawdammit, Jay, why do you have to make things so complicated?" he questioned with a sigh.
