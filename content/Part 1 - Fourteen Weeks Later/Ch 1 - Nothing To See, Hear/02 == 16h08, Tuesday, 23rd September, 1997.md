"Is that number five?" Spencer asked, gesturing at the cement truck backing into position to unload. Work was steady at the "[[JP Estate|country estate]]" of Jean-Pierre.

Susan nodded, glancing at her clipboard. "Yeah. Three more today, and then the same number again tomorrow. Then we wait a week and bring in five more."

Spencer shook his head. "That's one helluva hard hole in the ground," he chuckled.

She nodded and grinned. "Yeah. Bertrand tells me that the basement will take a hit with a thousand-pound crater-maker and shrug most of it off. I mean, everything above ground will get shaved off to the floor, of course, but the two basement zones will be fine."

"That's crazy. Is 'The Colonel' really worried about that ever happening?"

Susan looked up at her lover and nodded. "Yeah. He's had a lot of time to stew on the stunt with the water bomber and the Storm Kings. I don't think it's lost on anyone who knows about it that it's a pretty polite way to get rid of a lot of someones you don't much like."

"Is that why the 'ground floor' is almost your height above ground, and it's the top of the concrete box for the basements?"

"Un-huh. No windows, and no doors within six feet of the ground. Now, once the landscaping is done, it'll be more like four feet, but still."

"Are you folks still getting static from the County about the runway and helicopter pad?" Spencer questioned.

"Yeah, of course. Come on," she said as she started walking.

"Lead on, Beautiful. Just so it's said, even in a hard hat, cover-alls and work boots, you are hot as hell," Spencer grinned.

"Glad to hear you haven't gotten tired of the view yet," Susan replied with a smile.

"I am pretty sure that's something that won't ever happen. So you're in town until next Thursday?"

She shook her head. "No, I'm here for two weeks this time, so Thursday after next. There is just too much going on here for me to be away three weeks out of four now. So it's two up and two down until the place is ready."

"I know JP will have you put up in business class at the motel, but …"

"You're damn rights I'll be spending most of my nights out at the Camp," she interrupted. "Unless there is something big going on in Eden here, or JP needs me handling something while he's up and about, I'm six to six here, then it's in the Mazda and out to the Camp with you."

"Don't forget your girl, now," Spencer admonished.

"Oh, trust me, I won't. She's busy running the Club and handling her chair at the Granite Table. So, Friday night through to Monday morning, I'll be with her. Is that okay with you?"

"Oh, heck, Sue, of course it is. I'm not going to be mad at you needing to balance everything out. I'm just happy as hell I get to see you a bunch while you're here on business."

"I'm glad, Spencer. I keep thinking you're going to change your mind about all this. The girl from the other side of the tracks with a girl from the other side of the tracks, and all."

Spencer shook his head. "I'd be a crazy fool to throw away something this good, Sue. My momma didn't raise me to be a fool. A little bit crazy, yeah, sure, it comes with the paws, but not a fool."

Susan reached up, grabbed him by his collar and forcibly pulled him down so their lips met for a long moment. "I'm gonna want more of that and more than that after the bonfire tonight," she stated.

"Well then, let's just call me a lottery winner," Spencer laughed.

"Clean sheets, man. Don't make me have to make the bed when I get there this time, okay?"

Spencer laughed again. "Once! It was once!"

"And that was quite enough, thank-you. So, about the County and the runway," she said, gesturing to the area ahead of them towards where they'd been walking. "We want the approach to be either one-eight or three-six. That gives us the best path if we have to get something grumpy like an L-One-Thirty out of here."

"A HERC? What the Moon Shadows …?"

"JP doesn't even own one," Susan said with a shake of her head. "But that's not the point. The point is that he wants the option. So that means a North-South runway. Except that six minutes that-a-way at a hundred and thirty miles an hour is the [[County Airport|local County airstrip]]."

"Huh. That sounds a bit close," Spencer said thoughtfully.

"It is. This whole area is under air control from Denver International. They really don't want to be worrying about private traffic from here fouling the usual commuter and delivery runs out of the County port," Susan explained.

"This can't be a new problem. There are small ranch strips all over the midwest," Spencer stated, looking puzzled.

"You got it, big boy. It's lame BS. Which means something else is the real problem. Likely related to the Unseen World, since none of the red tape is making sense. So, it's going to be a lot of time on the phone and probably a few in person meetings to figure out what the real issue is and what it'll cost to get it cleared."

"This smells funny, Sue. You call me before you go off to any meetings, alright? I'm happy to be your driver; no solo stuff. Okay?"

"Thanks, sweetheart. I will absolutely take you up on that."

"Thank-you, Sue. I know you're tough stuff, with all the training you've gotten and such, but … one person is a lot easier to cause problems for than two."

"Oh yeah. Gabe taught me that. Back up is everything," she nodded. "Any word on that Hunter?"

Spencer shook his head. "Nope. After we ran down the trail to whatever that torched-out building out in the woods was, nothing. The whole area had been burned and then sprayed over with sulphur and Butyric acid. That was the end of that. Lady Red Mane and Sir Spooksalot came up empty too; someone knew how to wipe psychic signatures from an area. Completely blank slate."

"And not a word nor hint of him since peace was declared," Susan said with a thoughtful frown. "The local Observatory swears they have no clue what happened to him, according to Kaarina; apparently they're a bit embarrassed about that, in fact."

"This is starting to sound like a bad rework of that new Travolta movie, _Broken Arrow_," Spencer growled in aggravation. "So they've got an armed weapon lost somewhere and nobody who is supposed to be handling it can figure out why it's gone missing?"

Susan laughed and nodded. "When you sum it up that way, yeah, pretty much. Slater is such a pretty boy in that movie."

Spencer rolled his eyes. "Un-huh."

"You are so fun to tease, Spencer," she grinned at him. "And before you go objecting, I'll remind you who dropped their beer bottle on their own foot when the Reaper strolled by in a swim suit one evening. Hint; it wasn't the bi-chick."

"Fifth," he replied hastily. "You heard that Evie had her twins, yeah? A boy and a girl?" Spencer questioned, swiftly changing the topic.

She opted to let him get away with it; she had zero reason to doubt Spencer in any aspect of their relationship, even if there were days where her insecurities prompted her to.

She nodded and grinned. "Yeah, I'd heard. Samuel is alternating between Proud Uncle and Terrified Foster Dad; it's wildly cute to listen to."

"Um, I normally don't gossip, but did I hear right that he and Kaarina hook up for a night or two every couple of weeks?"

Susan nodded. "Yep. Vangie's idea, and I'm fine with it. They're mostly cuddle-friends who go the extra few inches once in a while. If it keeps the two of them from missing me and Vangie, respectively, and everyone is honest about it and where their feelings are in the whole thing, it's all good. I mean, I'm a Stripper at a men's club in the dockyard district of [[Glitter City - FLA|Glitter City]] who shacks up as often as I can with a hunky _Vülf_. I can hardly claim any kind of moral high ground," she laughed.

Spencer threw his head back and laughed. "Well, I suppose when you put it like that, it's kinda case closed, isn't it?"

"Yup."
