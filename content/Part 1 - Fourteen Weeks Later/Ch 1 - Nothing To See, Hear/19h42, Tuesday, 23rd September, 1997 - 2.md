A short while later, Emerret and Sheriff Jimmy Russell were having coffee and pie at [[Truck Stop - Hauler House|Hauler House]]. "So you came in here and walked face-first into a ten-fifteen as ten-thirty-one?"

Emerret nodded at his boss and had a mouthful of coffee. "S'right. It looked to me like they were fixin' to wreck the place."

"And you flashed the Shield, and they ran?" There was a thin note of skepticism in the question. The older man was twice Emerret's age, ten times his experience as a lawman, and about twice his weight. Russell was deceptively heavy-set; Emerret had seen him move an engine block by himself once. He was also a pragmatic lawman, one that was more interested in maintaining peace and order as opposed to enforcing every written law.

Emerret had heard allegations of corruption, but nothing that had ever become a court case. He found it hard to believe that his boss would be on the take, beyond the obvious free coffee at [Hauler House](Truck%20Stop%20-%20Hauler%20House.md) and the free drinks and extra attention at [Mahaybees](Strip%20Club%20-%20Mahaybees.md). He always had some pretty thing sitting in his lap with her arms around his neck.

"Yeah, that's pretty much it. A few private citizens were saddling up, and when the Perps realized I was an Officer, they bugged out. Motorcycles; sounded like Harley's to me."

"You got statements from witnesses?" The question was more business-like; apparently Sheriff Russell was willing to allow Emerret's version of events to stand unchallenged, so long as everything else lined up.

"Yup. I'll get the paperwork sorted in the morning."

[Peggy](person-PeggyCopeland-fsc.md) stopped by the table, topped off the two coffee mugs and smiled. Her face was still red from the slap she'd taken, with a hint of a forming bruise. "I'm so glad you came in when you did, Emerret," she said appreciatively. "I was kind of scared. Those thugs weren't looking for money, or nothing like that. They were looking to hurt people. I've seen those kinds of faces before, and they don't belong to people who think or feel the way regular folks do."

"I'm glad I was here to help, Peggy. You and the rest of staff, and the customers, don't need to be worrying about people like that."

"Amen to that, Sugar. Once was enough already, without it happening again. Sheriff, as a citizen and tax-payer here in the town, and the woman that makes sure your bacon is extra crispy on your hamburgers, I want you to know this young fella right here is a genuine credit to the force and a hero in my eyes."

Emerret was about to question something in her statement, until his brain caught up with the second half of it. He turned red and smiled, "That's mighty kind, Peggy. I was just doing my job."

"I will keep that in mind, Miz Copeland, and I'll ensure your remarks are noted to his file," the Sheriff said in a serious tone, clearly amused by the embarrassment evident with the younger officer. "Do us a favour, Peggy, and keep your ears open. If you hear tell about more of their sort around here, you call the Station right away. I'm not interested in having troublemakers taking up in the town; I'd rather make it real clear right away we don't want 'em."

"Will do, Sheriff. I'll pass the word around to the other girls and staff here."
