[[Rialto (Eden) Club Complex]|Eden] was busy; this was unsurprising to Emerret with Court in a couple of hours. Only Friday nights tended to be busier. Right now, there was a small crowd at the bar, the dance floor was buzzing, and a sizeable percentage of the tables were occupied.

The music was some alternative-rock anthem with a woman lead singer that he didn't immediately recognize; he was more of a country music fan. He spotted who he was looking for, and made his way over to their table.

"G'evening, Anoki. Can I get five or ten minutes of your time?" Emerret asked.

Anoki looked over his shoulder at Emerret from where he was seated. "You're the Cop, right?" The question was not describable as friendly.

"Annie, don't be like that. He's Lady Sharlene's Retainer," Lady Tiffany said sharply from her spot on the other side of the table.

"Yessir, my day job is a peace officer," Emerret replied.

"'_Peace Officer_', huh? So, tell me, when was the last time you practiced with your gun?"

"Annie!" Lady Tiffany sounded scandalized.

"Last weekend. Lady Sharlene insists that she and I visit the gun club together for at least an hour every week for training."

"Uh-huh. How about the last time you studied up on mediation or negotiation?" Anoki challenged, having a mouthful of his beer.

 "This morning," Emerret answered in an even tone. "I'm taking a couple of correspondence courses in my off-hours."

"Huh," Anoki said thoughtfully. "Alright, then. I guess you _can_ call yourself a Peace Officer around me. What do you need?"

"Emerret, isn't it?" Lady Tiffany questioned.

"Yes, Lady Keeper," he answered.

"Emerret, please, take a seat. And please, try to excuse the attitude problem beside me," she said, glaring at Anoki.

"Well, it's earned by proxy, Lady Keeper," Emerret said slowly as he sat down. "I know some of my fellow officers aren't at exactly at risk of winning a Nobel Peace Prize any time soon," he stated in an apologetic tone.

"That's one way of summarizing it, that's for sure," Anoki sighed. "But, Tiffster is right. You're Sharley's boy, so I should likely give you the benefit of the doubt. What can I do for you?"

"Well the Boss tells me you're The Man when it comes to things like tattoos, piercings and stuff."

"I like to think so, yeah," Anoki nodded.

"He totally is," Lady Tiffany said enthusiastically, nodding. "His stuff is getting used in salons and parlours around the world. Some of the Ladies of the Court here are wearing his work!"

Anoki grinned at Lady Tiffany. "Thanks, babe," he said, squeezing her hand where they were touching on the table. "My number one hype girl."

"I'm hoping you can answer a question or two. I'm wondering about a particular symbol I saw used in a design, and was wondering if there was any special meaning to it."

"I might be able to help. A lot of body art is just 'looks cool'. It's meaningless, in the same way that seeing someone wearing a _Bones Brigade_ logo t-shirt doesn't even tell you the person is into skateboarding. Another set is all personal meaning stuff; memorial tattoos are like that. You can tell it's important, but without asking the owner about it, what the images mean is generally going to be a mystery," Anoki explained. He had a sip of his beer, and shifted in his chair for comfort. "The third category is the smallest, which is the stuff which is a sort of universal lexicon of iconography. Now, keep in mind, the word '_universal_' there is doing _a lot_ of lifting. What something as simple as an eagle means changes radically with how it's drawn, with who is wearing it, and what part of the world the viewer is from."

Emerret nodded. "Well, I'm probably barking at squirrels then, but we'll see. The bit I'm interested in looked like a stylized cross that you'd see on a German officer in a World War Two movie."

"Yep. I know what you mean," Anoki said with a nod. "It's properly called an 'Iron Cross'; it's got its origins in German Teutonic Knighthood. The Nazi army sort of made it infamous, but the Prussians used it, the _Weimar_ Republic used it, and the modern _Bundeswehr_ use it as part of NATO."

Tiffany shook her head. "The shit you can just rattle off some days is amazing, Annie," she said appreciatively.

"Art is my thing, babe. And that's just one of those symbols that gets used a lot in body art. Gang culture uses it, and so do the white supremacists. So, I know that one cold."

"Does it mean anything special if it's got a red fill and a purple outlining?" Emerret asked.

The answer was delayed by the arrival of a waiter who delivered refills to Tiffany and Anoki, and a new glass to Emerret.

"Where did you see that?" Anoki asked slowly.

"On a fella's cheek."

"I meant more like looking for _Carmen Santiago_."

"Hauler House, this afternoon," Emerret supplied.

"That's bad news. That's almost exclusively used by racist gangland assholes. '_Ethnic Purity_' types; but it's almost also exclusively European. It's pretty rare here in the States."

"No one I'd likely want to have in for coffee, is what you're sayin'?"

"No one I'd likely want to have _in_ my coffee, is what I'm saying," Anoki laughed. "Yeah, heap big _mui_ bad actors."

"Awright. Thanks very much. That's good to know. I'll go outta my way to make sure they understan' they ain't welcome 'round here," Emerret stated.

"Please do," Lady Tiffany said in a firm tone. "While human racist gangbangers officially aren't even remotely a concern of the Afterliving, I really don't want a bunch of them doing something around here that puts the national media spotlight on Spring Castle. I like our anonymous peace and quiet as it is."
