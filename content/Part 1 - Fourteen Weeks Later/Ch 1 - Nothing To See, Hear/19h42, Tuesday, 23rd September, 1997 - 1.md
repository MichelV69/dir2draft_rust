Emerret walked through the doors of [[Truck Stop - Hauler House|Hauler House]] at the worst possible moment for the bad guys. One of the three thugs was cursing at [Peggy Copeland](person-PeggyCopeland-fsc.md) and slapped her across the face.

The second hurled a ketchup bottle with surprising force into the dessert case, splattering everything a mixture of red and glass shards.

The third jumped onto a table, kicked the meals of the terrified patrons onto the floor and struck a pose. "I got something to say!" the tall, muscular and balding man shouted. "It's better to burn out, than to fade away."

"'Scuse me, y'all," Emerret said loudly. "Is there a problem here?" At first, he'd been concerned he'd walked in on the opening phase of Jukebox Rugby. Sharley had explained that one to him, and made sure he understood not to get involved. _Vülf_ stuff was _Vülf_ stuff, and Afterliving Retainers might get accidented by the non-locals. However, none of the Boys he knew were here. He certainly didn't recognize any of these three.

Everyone in the place, including the three thugs, turned and looked at him in surprise. He was off-duty, and wearing his usual work boots, jeans and denim shirt.

"Are you okay, Peggy?" Emerret questioned as he walked in slowly, keeping his eyes on the trio.

She rubbed the side of her face. "I've been hit harder by better looking," she replied.

"You boys seem to be making a scene. I'm not so sure that's so smart of you," Emerret stated.

"Fuck you, asshole," the one standing on the table snarled. Emerret couldn't help but notice the extensive body-art he wore, including what looked like an "iron cross" on his right cheek. "Go home to your momma before you get hurt, boy," the thug growled.

Emerret chuckled. "Let's try this again, before I decide to set you three straight. You there, Sinatra, get off the table; you over there, Rocky, you ever lay a hand on anyone again, I'll step on your fingers; and you over there, Quisenberry, you put two hundred by the cash register on the way out the door, or it's coming out of your hide."

The three of them laughed at him and all began moving towards him, with malice in their eyes.

"Before you three do anything I'm going to have fun with, I should mention a detail," Emerret stated, and pulled out his wallet. He flipped it open, displaying his badge.

The trio stopped. "Fucking cop, huh? Going to hide behind that after your big talk?" 'Sinatra' glowered. "Cops have accidents, you know that, yeah?"

"You know, I'd say you were a pretty dumb cunt for threatening an officer in front of a room full of witnesses, but it's pretty obvious you don't have the depth or the warmth. I'd call you a stupid asshole, but I don't think you provide any functions nearly that vital, and I don't think y'all are that bright."

The three all took a few steps towards him. "You want to be careful there, Cop. You have no clue who you're dealing with."

Emerret raised an eyebrow. "Well now, how's about we go find out. I'll leave my badge here at the counter, and we all go outside and see who you three fools are."

"Excuse me, is there a problem here?" Macy Bridges, a brick wall of a man, and the night mechanic, walked in from out back with a ten-pound pipe-wrench in one hand, and the other one wrapped past his wrist in rags.

The trio looked back at Macy, and then towards Emerret.

One of the truck drivers stood up, a steak knife in his hand. "Excuse me, is there a problem here?" the burly driver questioned, making his way to stand beside Emerret.

Adeline, one of the cooks, came out from the kitchen with a meat cleaver in her hand and stood beside Peggy. "Excuse me, is there a problem here?" Adeline repeated.

A few more people got up from their chairs armed with whatever was at hand.

"I think it's time for you three fellas to leave," Emerret stated. "I'd hate to see three upstanding citizens like yourselves get lynched due to a misunderstanding. Now, y'all don't forget to be leaving a hundred or so each behind you to cover your tabs … because, you know, I might not see what happens if you don't."
