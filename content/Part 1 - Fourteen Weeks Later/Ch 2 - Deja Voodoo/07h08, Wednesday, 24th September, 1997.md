Emerret came down the outside stairs from his third floor apartment. There was an inside elevator, of course, but until snow made the outside stairs impractical, he preferred them. It was just after seven A.M., the sun had only been up for barely twenty minutes, and the clearing morning mountain skies promised a beautiful day. The rain and mist from the prior day had cleared overnight, and the air had warmed slightly.

He paused at the bottom of the stairs, glancing back at the building. He'd moved in to the top-floor apartment barely more than two months ago, mostly at Sharley's request. The street-level floor of the brand-new building was a women's-only health and fitness club, the second floor was an accounting firm that had questionable ties to the Smaldota Family of Denver, and the third floor was his.

Of course, Sharley owned the fitness club, the accountants were there because of Lady Kaarina, and as the Reaper's Retainer, he was the after-hours on-site security. She'd paid to have pros decorate his pad exactly how he wanted it, and then for movers to get all his stuff relocated from his old place. The truth of the matter was that his weekly expense allowance from Sharley meant he didn't need to ever punch in on shift at the Station again. However, he wasn't ready to just close up his old life and career yet. So, he kept putting the uniform on and working his four ten-hour shifts a week.

"Hiya!" Rosie bounced out of thin air into his personal space and wrapped him in a big hug. She was dressed for a night at a honky-tonk, smelled slightly of beer and cologne, and she had a small kitbag slung over her shoulder.

"Good grief, woman! Warning is good!" Emerret spluttered, yet again baffled how she seemed to be able to just be in his personal space without hint or prior detection. She plainly delighted in sneaking up on him, no matter how she managed it.

She laughed and playfully smooched him for a moment. "Heya, big boy! This is more warning than you were going to get. I considered having you wake up to find me in bed with you. But, you know, breaking into a Cop's apartment when I was more than a little drunk just didn't seem that smart. So I _Vülf_-napped until the sun came up and then wandered over. Ready for your morning run, yeah?" Rosie enquired, gesturing at his outfit.

He nodded at her question. "Yeah, I was about to get started on puttin' four miles behind me. Do you want me to let you in, so's you can get a shower and coffee while I'm running? It's always good to have you visit, Rosie."

She shook her head. "Nah. Just let me change my shoes and I'll run with you. Can I buy you breakfast over at the [[Restaurant - Milltown Diner|Milltown Diner]] after the run?"

"I'm not gonna turn that offer down. Let's go!"

The pair set off at an easy pace of an eight-minute mile. They chatted about whatever caught their attention as they made their way along his usual route. As they jogged, he reflected on his relationship with the mercurial and often impulsive woman beside him. If Sharlene had been lust at first sight, and Jeanie had been mutually drunken impulse between co-workers, Rosie was a one-night stand that had yielded a surprising friendship.

She was full of life and possessed of a nearly incandescent thirst for activity. They'd gone dancing a few times at the local country-music club, and that was always an awful lot of fun. She'd drank him under the table a couple of times on nights out, which usually resulted in her staying the night to make sure he was okay in the morning.

She was a remarkably 'earthy' girl, as were most of the _Vülfen_ women he'd met. So, they wound up in bed again a couple of times, at her request, since they'd first met at the _Battle of [de Villerary Farm](de%20Villerary%20Farm.md)_.

When he gave it any thought, they were as close to "good friends with benefits" as he could imagine any pair being, without him feeling a need to propose. Sharlene had commented on Rosie's interest in him a couple of times with a thinly veiled jealousy. Both Jeanie and Rosie had essentially made the same comment; until Sharley made some kind of commitment to him about a relationship, who he spent time with for fun — in or out of bed — was none of her concern.

"Well?" Rosie prompted.

"Huh? Oh! Sorry. Head was in the clouds."

"Clouds? Or my cleavage?" Rosie teased. Like the rest of the _Vülf_ girls, she had the figure of a _Sports Illustrated_ swimsuit girl, and knew it.

"Clouds," he insisted with a grin.

"Un-huh," she laughed. "I was asking if you were going to be coming out to the [[Spring Castle Pack Camp (new)|Camp]] tonight? Susan, Sherman, Ginster, Torchbrake and a couple of others are going to start working on the build for my brother's off-road rally ride. Suzie-girl and Kaarina are putting up the money to do it."

"Off-road rally? Well, I'm not much of a mechanic, Rosie," he answered thoughtfully as they crossed a street. "But, I mean, I can always be an extra set of hands for fetchin' stuff and the like."

"Un-huh! And it'll be fun; play music too loud, have a few home-brews, bend some metal, twist some wrenches, pop some rivets, and then sit and talk schemes by the bonfire for a bit."

"I'll have to go easy on the beer, since I'll have to drive home after," Emerret pointed out.

"You can be such a ditz," she said with a laugh. "Stay in my trailer and drive home in the morning. We can shake the bed if you want, or just cuddle and crash."

"Well, hell, that sounds like a great way to spend the evening, then," he grinned.
