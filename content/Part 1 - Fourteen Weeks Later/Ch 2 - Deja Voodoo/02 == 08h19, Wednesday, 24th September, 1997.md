"You're not going to be late for work, are you, Emerret?" Rosie asked after glancing at her wrist watch. She had a mouthful of her orange juice.

Emerret shook his head. "Naw. I shouldn't even be reporting for duty today, where I was part of a violent crime incident. Policy is that I should be off with pay for four shifts, or until I'm cleared by investigation against wrong-doing on my part."

Rosie raised an eyebrow. They were seated at the [[Restaurant - Milltown Diner|Milltown Diner]], which was a nineteen-fifties themed place that served one of the best breakfasts in the County. Trying to get in here for brunch on Saturday or Sunday was a lost cause, but during the week it was much more manageable.

They'd gotten a booth away from the door and had been chatting while eating. Both of them had ordered the '_Philly Cheesesteak on French Toast_' with coffee. She'd gotten orange juice, and he'd gotten chocolate milk.

"Kind of a weird policy," she said after a moment.

"Naw. It's there to make sure that if the officer involved did something stupid or something went bad, he's not out in a uniform with his head caught up in what happened instead of what's going on. There are too many ways for a preoccupied or inattentive officer to screw up and get themselves hurt real bad."

"Alright," Rosie nodded. "That makes some sense when you explain it that way. So, how come you're going to the shop, then?"

"Incident report. I hate doing cop stuff at home," he explained as he cut a mouthful and slid it onto his fork. "So, I'll go into my desk, get it all done and dusted proper-like, and then head back to my place."

"Are you okay, big boy?" Rosie questioned. "You're sounding like you're in a different room."

"Oh, I'm sorry, pretty lady. It ain't a reflection on the company," he said with a sigh. "I just got a funny feeling about that whole thing at Hauler House yesterday. Like something ain't right with it."

Rosie nodded. She opened her mouth to speak, and then closed it slowly. She bit a lip. "You're … you're staying safe, yeah?"

"That's a funny question, Rosie. And, kind of a funny expression on your face. Your eyes look worried about something you're trying not to ask me," Emerret said, tilting his head as he focused his attention on the woman seated opposite him.

She sighed and had a sip of her coffee.

"Um. Yeah. It's part of how come I came to visit you," she said, sounding guilty.

"Oh?"

"Yeah. When I called the [[Spring Castle Pack Camp (new)|Camp]] this morning to check messages, 'cause I slept in town last night, Easystreet told me she'd had a Flash just before dawn this morning.

"She … she saw a huge fight, like a brawl between a couple of big groups of people, but it was all shadows and fog and green backlight, so she couldn't make out details. Then she saw a cop cruiser like yours all smashed to hell, and then, she saw someone get put down with a shotgun."

"Alright. What's that got to do with me?" Emerret questioned.

"Well, you're the only cop anyone in the Pack gives even half of a damn about," Rosie said slowly.

"So you're thinking that whole thing has something to do with me?"

She nodded quietly.

"So what's that likely mean?" Emerret asked sombrely.

"Well, that's the tricky part. We, um … don't know." Rosie answered, sounding apologetic.

"You don't know?"

She shook her head. "We don't know."

"So, Easystreet had a vision, it _sounds_ like pretty unhappy ending, it likely has something to do with me, but you don't know anything for sure?" Emerret questioned.

Rosie nodded and sighed. "Yeah. Pretty much."

"How wide is the time window?"

"Well … " Rosie trailed off and gave him a wane smile.

"You don't know," he said.

"No, not really. I mean, for the Crones, a '_Flash_' is usually something important, something soon and something the Universe has an opinion on.

"The Universe has an opinion?"

"Yeah," Rosie nodded. "Of course it does."

Emerret took the mental moment to remind himself that he was having breakfast with a werewolf, that he drank blood to be partially immortal, and his part-time lover was a vampire. That reframing of context made the notion that the Universe might have an opinion, that it chose to share with 20-something swimsuit models in flannel and denim, seem a bit more reasonable.

"Are you okay?" Rosie questioned.

"I think so. Just a lot to soak in. So, is it too much to hope that the Universe is pro-Cop?"

"The Universe is about as pro-Cop as N.W.A. is," she said with a laugh. "In summary, no, not very. The Universe is a whole lot pro-good-guys though," she continued. "Which is why we get let in on stuff. And, well, Emerret, you're one of the good guys, Cop or not." She reached across the table and patted his hand, chuckling.

"I guess I'll consider that a compliment. From both you and the Universe," he chuckled.

The conversation was interrupted by the waiter stopping by the table to check for refills, happiness and dessert orders. Thoughtful silence filled the space between them while they sipped and munched once the waiter had departed.

"So, about that premonition," Rosie began slowly.

"Yeah?"

"There is a way the Crones have to call back for more information, as it were. But, because none of them know you very well, they need a Talisman."

"A what?"

"A Talisman; an emotional focus. Something of yours that you've had for a long time, that you really like and symbolizes an achievement or some big thing in your life. They can use that to tune the radio, for lack of a better way of explaining it, and get maybe get a better understanding of the initial vision, or even maybe some precise details."

After a moment of consideration, he slipped a ring off his hand and slid it across the table to Rosie. "My high-school grad ring," he explained. "I'm the first fella in my family to have one. It took me two tries to get that. I didn't quit. I worked hard. I had to ask for help a lot of times. I took some punches. That ring is my proof to me and everyone who told me I couldn't do it, that I could. If there is anything I have that's what you call a Talisman, that'd have to be it. Take good care of it, Rosie. It means a lot to me."

Rosie nodded. "I will, Emerret. Thanks for trusting me. And for believing me. I … I was kind of worried you'd laugh or something."

Emerret shook his head. "Naw. You're worried for real. I can see that much in your eyes. This is serious stuff for you. I try to be respectful of what folks believe, even if it don't make much sense to me. So, the way I figure it, if it turns out to be nothing but hocus-pocus, then me being respectful ain't doing no harm. On the other hand, if it turns out to be something concrete that maybe means I don't get hurt so bad, or I can make sure someone else don't get hurt? Well, then it's well worth me being respectful of what you and your folks believe in. Same price to me, either way," he concluded with a shrug.

Rosie stared at him in visible disbelief for a moment and then slowly reached across the table and took one of his hands in hers.

"You are one helluva fella, Emerret," she said softly. "There are times when you talk I'd swear you're a knight in shining armour that's just slumming in GWG's. I understand why Sharley wants to keep you all to herself. She is such a lucky bitch."

Emerret snorted. "You're making a lot of assumptions there, Rosie."

"Oh?" She blinked, clearly puzzled.

"Un-huh. First is that she's mentioned wanting to keep me all to herself to me. She hasn't. And, honestly, she sure don't much act like it unless one of us is tasting blood. Otherwise, she and I can go most of a week without anything but mentioning work between us. Second thing is that even if she did tell me she wanted to be my only girl, well, it ain't automatic I'd agree. I mean, she's my Boss. I ain't so sure that dating my Boss is all that smart, you know?"

"But … " Rosie blinked. "I mean, it's Sharlene! She's a _bombshell_! Fuck, most of the _Vülf_ guys can't help but watch her walk by, and it's not like any of us girls at the Camp are plain-Janes. She's got the curves, the smile, the walk, the moxie, the whole warrior-princess thing, and she's immortal! Why _wouldn't_ you want to date her?"

"She's my Boss," Emerret repeated. "Look, there's some stuff I can't say in a place like this. And honestly, Rosie, you kind of bumped into a bit of it, so mind how loud you're being. Security is everything on my side of the grid-iron."

"Yeah, yeah, you're right. I'm sorry. Um, back to your place, maybe? Is that okay?"

He raised an eyebrow. He wasn't really used to Rosie asking if something was okay. She tended to just invite herself to wherever and whatever she wanted. He rarely minded, but it was a quirk of hers that he found a bit tiring at times.

Her entire expression was one of concern and worry. In her eyes was something deeper, though, that he couldn't identify. She clearly wasn't done with this conversation, and it was obviously important to her.

He nodded. "Let's get the bill settled, get a couple slices of French-style '_Sugar Pie_' to go, and we'll hit the little coffee shop just down the hill from my place on the way by. We can hang out in the living room, put some music on and talk as much as you want."

She giggled with an uncharacteristic nervousness. "I don't shut up much, you know?" Rosie said in mock warning.

"Oh, yeah, I noticed that about you, trust me," he replied with a wink.
