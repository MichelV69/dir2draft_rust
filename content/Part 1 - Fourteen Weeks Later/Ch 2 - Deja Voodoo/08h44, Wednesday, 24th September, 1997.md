Rosie sighed contently as her lips left his. "Is … is this okay?" The question was surprising to Emerret.

The stereo was playing some moody country music by Garth Brooks, they were on his couch with her in his lap straddling him, and most of his shirt buttons undone. Admittedly, he hadn't been too shy about pulling her shirt out of her waistband, but the buttons were still done.

They'd been lazily making out for more than two or three songs, after she'd demolished her slice of pie and quaffed back about half her extra large double espresso with cream. He wasn't completely sure how they'd gotten to this point in the non-conversation, but he also wasn't completely sure he felt like objecting.

Being an apparent babe-magnet was something he was still getting used to. He hadn't been all that popular in high school, and few of his relationships after graduation from the Academy had amounted to more than curious flings. There were too many complications with being the new cop in town to have anything like a steady girlfriend.

Then he'd met Sharlene, and then Jeanie and Rosie. All three had been more than happy to share either a bed or a shower with him. Of the trio, Jeanie had been the most blunt and honest about it being a purely physical interest, based on circumstances, inebriation and frustration.

The fuss the waitresses at the Hauler House made over him had largely caught him off guard; he'd mostly written it off as tip-hunting until Peggy had all but given him a list of staff girls who would be delighted to get a call from him. Admittedly, he hadn't called more than most of them.

He nodded at her, and kissed her gently. "Yeah, o'course, Rosie. You're a helluva woman, and I ain't much for turning down someone like you."

"You are such a charmer, Emerret," she grinned.

"Well, I am still a bit curious about what it was you wanted to keep talking about, but this is feeling awful good so I'm not feeling too hasty about changing it."

"Well, you'd been talking about not wanting to date your Boss, but said there was stuff you couldn't talk about in public," she reminded him, idly running a couple of fingers down the furrow of his chest. Her hands were always so warm on his skin, in a completely distracting way.

He nodded at her. "That seems a bit of an odd topic, given the situation right now," he chuckled.

She shook her head. "I'm gonna be jealous no matter what we're doing, and this is feeling really good right now."

"Why would you be jealous?" Emerret questioned.

She rolled her eyes and shook her head. "My mom was right. '_Fellas can be dumb as tree-stumps at times_'." She sighed, took his face between her hands, and kissed him soundly and deeply for as long as she could manage.

"Now do you understand?" Rosie asked in a whisper with barely a gap between their mouths. He could feel her heated breath on his lips.

"You're kidding, right?" Emerret replied, feeling and sounding dumbfounded.

She shook her head. "No."

"If this is how it is, then why in the name of summer thunder are you so sure I should be dating Sharley?" He was completely baffled.

Rosie bit her lip. "Well, because you never seemed that interested. And, well, I can't say as I blame you. Sharley's the fucking Reaper of Eden, and I'm what? A plant picker that makes a good stew," she answered glumly.

She shook her head and continued in a quiet, defeated voice. "She's immortal, and I'm dead before I'm fifty. She's got a luxury condo in a gated community and drives a Saleen. I live in a camper trailer out in the woods and own a second-hand, dented street-and-trail motorcycle. With her figure and all, she must be a fantastic piece of tail for a fella like you. When I get pissed-off, I grow a tail. So, you know … " She trailed off with a sigh.

"Why _wouldn't_ you be all stars-in-your-eyes and bulge-in-your-pants for her?" Rosie concluded after a moment.

He shook his head. "Because, unlike you, she can't be honest with herself about what she wants for herself. I dunno if she even really knows. Honestly, Rosie, she makes me feel like a trophy wife, 'cept for the part where she won't commit that much to us." Emerret paused for a moment, glanced around briefly and then nodded. He untangled one of his hands from her and gestured at a closed door beside his bedroom. "So, you can have that room, I guess."

"Wait now. Hold on here. _What_ did you just say?" She blinked at him in shock.

"I said you can have that room right there," he replied with a shrug. "It's mostly empty, anyway. I'll just need to get my weights and a few storage bins out of there and moved somewhere else. The place is plenty big, so it's not like it's a real inconvenience."

"Did … did you just ask me to move in with you?" Rosie blurted.

"Sort of? More like I told you, but, that's close enough," he replied. "I mean, it's up to you, but, I can't see much point to you _Vülf_-nappin' in a tree or on a roof somewhere just 'cause you can't drive your bike. Particularly with me having a big place like this all to myself. And seein' as how you feel about me, it seems to make sense to me that you'd have your own space in my life so we can spend more time together, and get to know each other better without you havin' to choose between a couch and my room."

"Are you sure this would be okay? It won't cause you problems?" Rosie asked, sounding cautious.

"Well, since we ain't talked about being steady or even one-and-only, I figure it shouldn't be a big deal. I ain't gonna lie to you, Rosie, I do have two other women in my life that like their sleep-overs. Sharley's one, and another is a Retainer from [[Glitter City - FLA|Glitter City]] named Jeanie. But, if that's more than twice a month with either of them, it's a busy schedule. Sharley's got her own place, like you said, and when Jeanie's in town, her Boss puts her up in style downtown in one of the fancy hotels. So, that's nothin' you'd have to put up with directly."

Rosie nodded. "That's more than fair, Emerret. Us _Vülf_ girls are pretty easy, so it's not like I can complain about you keeping a couple of side Squeezes. Particularly with Sharley being one of them. So … You're serious about this?"

Emerret grinned at her. "Yep. The worst that happens is you decide I'm a lot less fun full-time than you thought, and we just go back to how things are now. But, with my schedule and you being out at the [[Spring Castle Pack Camp (new)|Camp]] all the time, I don't see an easier way to date. I'm thinking we just keep a simple rule that each's person's bedroom is Private Property and the other person doesn't go in without bein' invited. And nothing is automatic; if we want something, we've gotta talk about it. So, mostly roommates with some spice, if you want to think of it that way."

"I like things Cajun," she challenged with a grin.

"Is that a yes?" Emerret questioned with a chuckle.

She nodded, licked her lips and pulled his fly down.
