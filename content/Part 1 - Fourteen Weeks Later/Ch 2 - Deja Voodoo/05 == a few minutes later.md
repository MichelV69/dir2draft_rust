A few minutes later, the pair were walking along the firehose that lead to the waterfall and stream. "So when were you planning on telling me about this arrangement between you and Rosie?" Sharlene questioned in an obviously annoyed tone.

"Whenever it came up in conversation," Emerret replied. "At the rate you and I have casual conversations, probably next month."

Sharlene shot him an absolutely foul look. "Don't be an asshole, Em. It's not a good look for you."

"Be less of a scornful bitch, Sharley," he countered. "It's not a good look for you."

Sharlene stopped sharply and turned towards him. "What the fuck is with your attitude lately, Emerret?"

"My '_attitude_' is just that I _refuse_ to have you treat me the way your Dad treated your Mom," he snapped back.

Before either of them fully realized what happened, she'd back-handed him hard enough to take him off his feet and send him tumbling into a heap of ferns and moss. He was about to snarl something uncharacteristically unpleasant when he looked towards her and stopped.

She was standing there, weirdly lit by a shaft of moonlight filtering through the trees, looking at her hand in numb horror. A single red tear traced down her pale cheek, and she bit her lip against a threatening flood.

Emerret got up, went to her, gently moved her hand from between them, and wrapped her in a hug. "Go on," he said quietly. "You need to."

She burst into tears, and clung to him, sobbing apologies. "I'm so sorry, Em … I'm so sorry! What the hell is wrong with me? How could I _do_ that? How could I be so _horrible_? You're my friend!"

"Shhhh. I ain't gonna tell you that it's okay, 'cause it ain't. But, I understand. A lot of women in my family had bruised cheeks, too. It's what you know. It's all that you know. It's what '_normal_' is. And, with you being Afterliving, well, that sort of makes you the '_fella_' with you and I. So, you're just doing what your Daddy did. It ain't right. It ain't _never_ been right. But, it's all you've got."

She held onto him, continuing to make noises of shock, horror and apology. Red stained the shoulder and front of his shirt, tinglingly warm with an annoyingly inviting smell. It made concentrating on her frustratingly difficult for him.

"Come on. I guess we've got some talking to do," he said. He took her by the hand that had struck him, and led her silently up the slope to where the head of the _Trompe_ rig was set up, near a natural pond that spilled over the adjacent steep slope in a series of noisy flows and falls.

He pulled his shirt off and threw it in the pond. He helped her out of her clothes, got undressed himself, and they settled together with her cuddled against him, using a large sloped stone in the pond as a back rest.

Minutes of silence between them passed, with nothing more than the sounds of a puzzled owl and a concerned squirrel interrupting the rustle of the evening mountain breeze through the trees. He absently thought that he'd have to be careful; the air and water were just cold enough for him to worry about getting a deep chill.

"Are you okay?" Emerret asked, using fresh water on his thumb to wipe away the stains under her eyes.

"Yeah. I think so," she replied quietly. Her voice was her usual tone of calm self-confident business. "If …" Her facade crumbled as she trailed off, hesitated, and started again.

"If you want out of this arrangement between us, Em, I wouldn't blame you," she said in a now nearly emotionless voice. "I'm sure the Lady Keeper would be happy to have you as her Retainer, even as just a favour to me, so you wouldn't lose out on anything. You shouldn't lose your shot at immortality just because I'm a broken bitch. And I'll respect your wishes if … if you want me to stay out of your life for the rest of it."

"Naw. That's just you running away from your self-disappointment," he shrugged, which set little ripples in the water dancing away from them. "Same as your Daddy did. You ain't gonna learn a better way like that."

She tilted her head to meet his gaze. "You can be _such_ an asshole, you know that, right?"

"You've mentioned it a couple times since we stared down this road, yeah," he said with a chuckle. He shifted his hand from her shoulder to her hip. Her skin was wonderfully smooth and warm under his hands; _Conceit of the Living_. "Usually when I'm pointin' out somethin' you don't like. I s'ppose the question is if you really want me out, or if this ain't just you punishin' yourself."

"I … I don't want to lose our friendship, Em," she said slowly.

"Well, that's good t'hear, because I ain't all that fond of the idea of losing our friendship, neither, Sharley. You're good people, down deep. I've seen that part of you a lot of times. You've just got some unlearnin' to do, like I did, and I wouldn't be much of a friend if I walked out on you just when you decide to get started."

She smiled softly and shook her head slightly. "I really don't deserve you."

"Don't be foolish, woman. Of course you do."

She lightly kissed him and then pursed her lips. "Be with Rosie. I hope she makes you happy. I've got forever. She doesn't. If I grow up a bit, we can talk again when we're both ready."

"What's that all mean?" Emerret questioned.

"Well, unless you object, it means back to a glass for you, and I keep my fangs to myself. We stay out of bed unless you're completely sure it's what you want. You're Rosie's fella, and you're my friend and co-worker."

"That's a big change between us. You sure that's what you want?"

"I … I don't see a better way, Em. You're right; I _have_ been treating you the way Dad treated my Mom. If that's how I am with someone I say I love, then, well … you deserve better and I need to learn better. It's not fair to you to miss out on other chances to be happy while I sort my mess out."

"That all makes sense. Bein' someone's friend, and bein' in love with someone is about bein' happy and makin' happy. Everyone talks all the talk about makin' love, but I think it'd be a whole lot better if we thought more about makin' happy."

She smiled and shook her head. "I have no idea how you do that, Em. You can take a whole textbook and turn it into a sentence. You are such a damn smart guy."

"Thanks, Sharley. Now, if we're gonna stay friends, then I need you to stay honest with me. Alright? No bullshit, no hidin', no holdin' back; none of that. If kissin' me is the truth, then just kiss me. If cryin' is the truth, then cry. Same with laughin' and yellin'. Alright? The other thing is we try to talk to each other a lot more; even just emails and phone-texts."

She nodded. "Yeah. You're right. Let's at least check in with each other every evening once I'm walking. Thanks, Em. We should probably get back to the others. And you're starting to shiver a bit; I don't want you catching pneumonia."

He nodded and then kissed her, because it felt like the right thing to say.
