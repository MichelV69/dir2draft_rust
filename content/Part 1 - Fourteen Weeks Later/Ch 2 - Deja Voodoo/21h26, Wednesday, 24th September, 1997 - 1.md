"Whoa. Wait. Hold on. Pump the brakes. _What_ did you just say, Rosie?" Sharlene asked.

"I was telling Kaarina that I'm taking over Emerret's spare room. It'll make it easier to get a part-time job in [[Spring Castle - CO|Spring Castle]], and spend time with Emerret," Rosie answered as she compared wrench sockets to a bolt she had in her hand.

They were out at the [[Spring Castle Pack Camp (new)|Camp]], in a just finished work-shop that had gone up over the previous two weeks as a joint effort of most of The Boys. It was three widths of a Cadillac wide, and twice as long. The floor was a sandwich of three layers of boards, with each layer set at an angle to the one above it, which provided significant strength. Every piece of wood in the place had been treated using the Japanese _Yakisugi_ technique and then given a liberal coat of mineral oil before it met a nail or peg.

The building was two full person heights before the peak started to rise, with pairs of light sockets set high on the walls. A floodlight was aimed upwards to get rid of the shadows, and a hooded bulb was beside that to provide a more general ambient light to work.

A set of tracks, mounted high on the walls and made of lumber, supported a crane rig. It could roll the whole length and width of the place by use of pulleys, ropes and chains. A couple of solid fellas could move a pick-up truck's engine block or transmission around with relative ease.

Cabinets, shelves and bins lined the three walls with everything they could scrounge and salvage, giving them nearly everything they could need for working on vehicles. Ten PSI air was provided by a _Trompe_ pump, running off modest brook flowing down the hill past the [[Spring Castle Pack Camp (new)|Camp]]. A re-purposed fire hose carried the air into the shop from the reservoir, and that topped off a pair of fifty-gallon steel drums via a pressure valve. The drums, in turn, were coupled to a manifold. The manifold provided hook-ups for the various air-tools in the shop, including the drop-hammer.

The Boys had put up a _Playboy_ calendar as well as a couple of pin-up posters. That resulted in Vangie and Sharlene having put up a _Playgirl_ calendar with dire threats against tampering. A salvaged and repaired "_Franken Stereo_" was playing the local rock music station, mostly tuned properly.

Vangie had laughed at a recent bonfire that it said a lot about the Pack that they hadn't yet managed to decide what they wanted the Community Hall to look like after more than half a year of being here, but had put up a damn fancy Speed-Shop in less than three weeks. There had been some guilty laughter, some amused commentary and sheepish looks. The trees had started coming down for the Community Hall a couple days ago.

Spencer and Ginster were currently using an arc welder to work on a square frame of steel sitting on jack posts and wooden blocks. Torchbrake and Sparks were over at a desk against the wall, arguing over voltage requirements and the resulting size of battery and alternator. Susan and Sharlene were cutting pre-marked lengths of steel with a grinder and shears. Emerret was near a work bench and cabinets, putting together an inventory list, while putting content tags on bins and drawers. A salvaged pile of bolts and such were being sorted by Kaarina and Rosie, to be ready for use as Ginster demanded them.

Susan and Rosie had joined forces a few weeks ago to make Spencer's life-long dream come true. They were going to build a _Baja_-grade off-road rally racer, and start training. By this time next year, they wanted to have a trio of podium finishes at lesser races around the country, and then register for the next _Baja One Thousand_. Sherman and Sue were the planned crew, with Rosie as the spare.

The whole Pack, and a couple of the Afterliving, had taken up the banner. As of an hour after sunset this evening, steel had started meeting cutters and welders in the grand endeavour. The two Afterliving women were both forced to wear mirrored wrap-around sunglasses against the harsh flicker and painful flare of the arc-welder. Even the spark-showers from the grinding wheel were painful for the pair to look at.

Banter, beer, debate and music had been ample as the group worked. That had ground to a sudden halt just now, after Sharlene had caught a corner of the conversation between Kaarina and Rosie.

"Em?" Sharlene demanded. "Is that true?"

Emerret looked over his shoulder towards her. "It's a funny thing for a woman to lie about, particularly with me standin' right here, don'cha' think?"

"That's not an answer to my questions, Em," she growled.

He sighed irritably and then nodded. "Yep, what she said is truth. Rosie's thinkin' of workin' with the County Ambulance and Paramedics Service. So, her havin' a place closer to town will make her shifts easier to handle. And, like she says, it'll make it easier for her and I to spend time together."

Everything had gone quiet in the workshop, and everyone was aware of the tension slowly crawling upwards.

"She finally 'fessed up, did she, Emerret?" Spencer questioned. Emerret liked Spencer; he could easily read a room, but at the same time there was a reason his Pack-name was "_Sherman_" and it wasn't entirely just his shoulder measurement. Emerret periodically wondered what Sherman thought of him; he worked the door and stroll at _Mahaybees_, and they'd seen each other there a few times, both on and off duty.

"Pardon?" Emerret answered, sounding puzzled.

"Oh, for the past couple of months, it's a weird quiet if I don't hear your name out of her mouth at least every second or third day. I was wondering when she'd get around to asking you to shack up," Spencer said with a grin. "You take proper care of my little sister, y'hear?"

"I hear, for sure, friend," Emerret answered with a tap of the beak of his ball cap.

"So you two are dating and moving in together?" Sharlene growled.

"Yup," Rosie answered. "You don't seem that happy for us, Sharley." Her tone was fairly pointed.

Kaarina cleared her throat in an entirely artificial way. "Easy, my friend," she said to Sharlene. "I will suggest to you that this is hardly ideal circumstances for you and your Retainer to discuss personal matters."

The look directed at Kaarina wasn't entirely a glare. Sharlene snorted in aggravation and then looked at Emerret.

"Let's go for a walk," she said.

Emerret gestured at the cabinet he was sorting through. "Kind of in the middle of something, Sharley," he said.

"That wasn't a request, Retainer," Sharley stated flatly.

"Hey! That's not â€¦" Rosie's squawk of protest was cut off by Emerret raising a hand towards her.

"Sure thing, Boss," he said, wiping his hands on a rag. "Lead the way."
